r2 should be high
RMSE should be low

Data Preparation:
    1. Acquisition
    2. Cleaning
        -remove missing(null) values
        -remove errors?
    3. Feature Selection
    4. Data Formatting

Feature Selecion:
    1. Eliminate Dependent Variables
    2. Does each variable have sufficiently wide range of values?
    3. Are any variables good potential predictors?
    4. Remove duplicate variable

    Correlation:(Strong correlation with label are useful)
        0 No correlation
        1 Strongly Correlated
       -1 String Correlated

    Eliminating Duplicate data:
        Eliminate two features having Strong correlation

Transformers and Estimators:(extends Abstract class PipelineStages)
    Transformer = Object on which we call transform method. returns Dataset
    Estimators = Object on which we call fit method. returns Transformers
